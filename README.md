I was cleaning my basement when i founded an old computer that belonged to my brother ages ago. Instead of throwing it away, I looked into what I could do with it and came across the concept of home servers.
### ðŸ¤” Whats is an home server?
A home server is essentially a dedicated computer in your house that runs continuously to provide services to all your other devices. Think of it as the central hub of your home network. Instead of relying on various cloud services, you can use your own server for things like:

* Centralized storage: Storing all your family photos, videos, and documents in one place.

* Media streaming: Running a media server like Plex or Jellyfin to stream your movies and music to any screen.

* Smart home automation: Managing your smart lights, speakers, and other devices.

* Data backups: Creating a reliable backup for all your computers and phones.

By using a home server, you gain more control, privacy, and flexibility over your data and services.
